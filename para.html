         React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free 
         and open-source front-end JavaScript library
         that aims to make building user interfaces based on components more "seamless".<br>
         It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
         React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, 
         or server-rendered applications with frameworks like
         Next.js and Remix[a].<br> Because React is only concerned with the 
         user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications 
         often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality.<br>
         [11][12] A key advantage of React is that it only re-renders those parts of the page that have changed,
          avoiding unnecessary re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements.<br>ReactJS is a component-based JavaScript library used to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces. It simplifies the creation of single-page applications (SPAs) with a focus on performance and maintainability.
